Hype VOIP
=====

Repository for the 3rd Year CS Project (2014-2015 term) assigned to Team H at Glasgow University. 

Hype is a simple VOIP client/server combination written in java, with basic user management and peer to peer communication. Hype's peer to peer calls currently do not perform any NAT traversal, so the software generally only works over LAN.

## Organization
